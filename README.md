# CS-305-Software-security

Artemis Financial is a financial institution looking to incorporate additional security into their already existing application. I enjoyed testing potential vulnerabilities in my code via static testing. Secure coding is important to protect not only your property but the property of your users. Personal information and trade secret loss can cause great harm to both people and businesses. Coding secure software helps to secure information and overall helps to protect a companyâ€™s reputation in the long run. The dependency check tool was the most helpful, it created a shortcut in detecting vulnerabilities Vs. checking each dependency by hand for vulnerabilities. Through testing most of the vulnerabilities were caused by using old libraries so by updating the libraries currently in use in the code more secure software is created. Using penetration testing in the future will better assess the and additional vulnerabilities within the code. Through coding the software, I continually ran debugs to ensure that it was functional. After refactoring the code, I ran another vulnerability test to check if any new vulnerabilities were introduced. I used stack overflow quite a bit and checked how peers were solving the same situations to mine, especially when running into errors in the console. I would say the way I send encrypted informatrion but the system is not letting me upload my certificate I created.
